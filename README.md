# Dog Breed Prediction Project

## Overview
This Dog Breed Prediction project is a Python-based machine learning application. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify dog breeds from images. The model, built with Keras and TensorFlow, currently supports predicting three dog breeds: Scottish Deerhound, Maltese Dog, and Afghan Hound. The project includes a Streamlit web app for easy interaction and demonstration.

## Features
- **Image Processing:** Uses OpenCV for image manipulation.
- **Deep Learning Model:** A Keras-based CNN for dog breed classification.
- **Streamlit Web App:** An interactive web interface for easy use.
